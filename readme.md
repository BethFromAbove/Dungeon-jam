# Dungeon-jam!

* A space-themed dungeon puzzle in zero-g
* Narrative: you are trapped in/on an asteroid/alien base and you need to get to the outside/centre so you can turn on the emergency beacon/activate the self destruct.
* Mechanics include: jumping from wall to wall in cardinal directions, changing direction in mid-air, restrcted vision
* Possible additions: alien tech theme, spikey walls, moving platforms, locked doors etc.

# Dave's first take on the core engine:

I tried messing around with the controls a bunch, but haven't quite found what I'm looking for. Currently you hold down a direction then hit space to jump. While in mid air you can hold down a direction and hit space again to throw a rock in that direction which will push you in the opposite direction.

also the code could be simplified a bunch :)
